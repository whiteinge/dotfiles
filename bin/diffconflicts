# Use *real* vimdiff to edit merge conflicts in Git
#
# Instead of editing a file with  <<<< ==== >>> conflict markers, this opens
# each "side" of the conflict markers in a two-way vimdiff window.
#
# (I'm not clear why this isn't the default behavior for Git's vimdiff
# mergetool script. What purpose does the 'result' window with the conflict
# markers serve that vimdiff can't do better on its own?)
#
# Layout:
#
#   Tab1 is a two-way diff of the conflicts.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |    LCONFL     |    RCONFL      |
#       +--------------------------------+
#   Tab2 is a three-way diff of the original files and the merge base.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |  LOCAL   |   BASE   |  REMOTE  |
#       +--------------------------------+
#   Tab3 is the MERGED or 'result' file that contains the conflict markers.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |       <<<<<<< HEAD             |
#       |        LCONFL                  |
#       |       =======                  |
#       |        RCONFL                  |
#       |       >>>>>>> someref          |
#       +--------------------------------+
#
# Workflow:
#
# 1.    Save your changes to the LCONFL temporary file (the left window on the
#       first tab; also the only file that isn't read-only).
# 2.    The LOCAL, BASE, and REMOTE versions of the file are available in the
#       second tabpage if you want to look at them.
# 3.    When vimdiff exits cleanly, the file containing the conflict markers
#       will be updated with the contents of your LCONFL file edits.
#
# NOTE: Use :cq to abort the merge and exit Vim with an error code.
#
# Add this mergetool to your ~/.gitconfig (you can substitute gvim for vim):
#
# git config --global merge.tool diffconflicts
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.cmd 'diffconflicts vim $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED'
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.trustExitCode true
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.keepBackup false
