# A better vimdiff mergetool for Git
#
# Git does a great job resolving merge conflicts automatically but there are
# times when human intervention is still needed. Git resolves all the conflicts
# that it is able to and finally wraps each conflict it cannot resolve within
# special markers which must be resolved by a human.
#
# The vertical format and lack of syntax highlighting in the plain conflict
# marker layout makes it difficult to spot subtle conflicts such as
# single-character changes and this is where a two-way diff really shines!
#
# This script creates 4 tab pages.  
#  - The first tabpage contains a 2-way diff of the LOCAL and REMOTE files.
#  - The second tabpage contains a 2-way diff of the LOCAL and BASE files.
#  - The third tabpage coontains a 2-way diff of the REMOTE and BASE files.
#  - The fourth tabpage contains the MERGED file showing the inline changes.
#
#
# Workflow:
#
# All changes should be saved in the LOCAL file.  If vim exits without an error code, this file will be used to continue
# the merge/rebase.
#
# Set the following git config settings:
#
#    merge.tool=diffconflicts
#    merge.conflictstyle=diff3
#    mergetool.prompt=false
#    mergetool.diffconflicts.cmd=diffconflicts $EDITOR $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED
#    mergetool.diffconflicts.trustexitcode=true
#    mergetool.diffconflicts.keepbackup=false
#
# NOTE: Use :cq to abort the merge and exit Vim with an error code.
