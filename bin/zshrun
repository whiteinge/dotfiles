# An OSX script to invoke a Terminal window and block until it closes. Uses the
# ZSHRUN flag and some Applescript to auto-close after invoking a command.
#
# One possible use is to invoke this from Qutebrowser, use a CLI password
# manager, then echo the result back into the Qutebrowser FIFO so the password
# appears in the HTML <input> field.
